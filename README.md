Within the core UHG environment, Enterprise Information Security (EIS) collects logs in the Enterprise Technology Data Lake (ETDL). Application logs in the ETDL which follow formatting guidance and contain adequate detail can be incorporated into log monitoring, investigation, and retention processes. Applications not utilizing ETDL for these services are responsible for making sure that the repository they use is able to provide security monitoring and log review.
